            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>We love a good peanut butter and jelly sandwich here at Allrecipes. From cupcakes to chicken wings, we’ve found a way to PB&J-ify just about everything—or so we thought. When senior culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin saw content creator @holmescooking making a peanut butter and jelly poke cake on TikTok, she said exactly what we were all thinking: “How have we never thought of this one before?” </p>
