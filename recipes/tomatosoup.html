            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet sheet with cooking spray. Place garlic bulb and onion on the prepared sheet. </li>
                <li>Roast until very tender, 40 to 45 minutes; remove from oven and let cool until cool enough to handle. </li>

                <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped roasted onions and 4 roasted garlic cloves to the hot oil, and cook and stir until fragrant, up to 1 minute. </li>
                <li>Add both cans of San Marzano tomatoes (including juice), vegetable stock, and agave syrup. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, about 15 minutes. </li>
